# v5 Migration Guide

## Both @socketdb/client and @socketdb/server need to be updated to v5

You need to update both the client and the server at the same time. This is because of a change how socket events are handled.

	<p>
The server now sends both added and deleted keys back to the client when
subscribed to a wildcard path.

Example response:

```diff
-{data: ['1', '2', '3']}
+{data: {added: ['1', '2', '3'], deleted: ['0']}}
```

</p>

</details>

## The store api has changed

The store from @socketdb/core now returns null if there is no data for a given path instead of always returning an empty node.

If you use a [custom store](/guide/custom-store) or use the store from @socketdb/core directly, update it to return null if there is no data for a given path instead of always returning an empty node.

```diff
export type Store = {
+	get: (path?: string) => Node | null;
-	get: (path?: string) => Node;
	put: (diff: Node) => Node;
	del: (path: string) => void;
};
```
