## Client does not automatically connect to the server anymore

The client now needs to be explicitly connected to the server. This is done by calling `client.connect()`.

```diff
-const db = SocketDBClient<Schema>({ url: 'ws://localhost:8080' });
+const db = SocketDBClient<Schema>();
+db.connect('ws://localhost:8080');
```
